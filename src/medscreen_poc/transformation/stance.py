"""Stance classification: does a candidate support, refute, or stay neutral on the claim
as asserted (conditions included)?

This is measurement instrumentation, not the production annotator. Using an LLM as the
stance judge here is acceptable precisely because the stance step is one of the variables
the harness measures. Its correctness shows up as the gap between retrieval recall and
stance recall. It must never be promoted into an "is this claim true" judge in a real
pipeline.

Backends are pluggable (see ``base.stance``):
  * ``stub`` is a deterministic lexical heuristic, dependency-free, for plumbing.
  * ``llm`` is any provider behind ``LLMClient`` (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) with a
    condition-aware prompt returning structured JSON. ``anthropic``, ``openai``, and
    ``gemini`` are accepted as aliases that also pin the provider.
