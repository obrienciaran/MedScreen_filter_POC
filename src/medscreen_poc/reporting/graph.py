"""Evidence graph visualization.

Turns stored run data into an interactive network. Claims and evidence papers are
nodes. A claim links to each evidence item the stance step judged, and the edge colour
shows the verdict (refutes, supports, neutral). A study known to disprove a claim is drawn as
a red dot when the search found it, and as a dark-yellow triangle joined by a dashed "not
retrieved" link when the search missed it, so recall gaps are visible at a glance. Retraction
links between papers are drawn as well.

``build_graph_data`` is pure and reads only from the store, so it is unit tested without
a browser. ``render_html`` writes a standalone interactive HTML file built directly on
vis-network (loaded from CDN), so there is no Python rendering dependency.
