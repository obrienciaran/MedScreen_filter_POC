"""Pydantic models shared by the data filter and the validation tool.

For the validation tool: a ``GoldEntry`` (a hand-authored claim we already know the
answer for) feeds retrieval, which produces ``Candidate`` evidence. Each ``Candidate`` is
judged by the stance step into a ``StanceLabel``, and the per-claim outcome is summarized
as a ``ClaimReport``.

For the data filter: a ``PaperRecord`` (one ingested paper) has its claims lifted into
``ExtractedClaim``s, each judged into a ``ClaimVerdict``, which roll up into one
``PaperVerdict`` per paper.
