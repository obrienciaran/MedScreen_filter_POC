"""Evidence retrieval for the filter: find the works that refute or debate a paper.

Behind the ``Retriever`` Protocol (see ``base.retriever``):
  * ``stub`` is offline. It uses the paper's own ``CommentsCorrectionsList`` links as the
    evidence pool. A ``RetractionIn`` becomes a refuting retraction notice, and a
    ``CommentIn`` or ``ErratumIn`` becomes a debating comment. There is no network, but
    the signal is real structure from the XML, so a retracted paper is correctly flagged.
  * ``live`` queries PubMed and Europe PMC for the claim and fetches the linked dispute
    PMIDs, reusing the existing Source machinery. It needs network access.

The pool is per paper and claim. The stub returns the same paper-level links for each
claim because it has no claim-level signal offline.
