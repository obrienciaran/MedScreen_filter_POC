"""Process-wide cache of retrieval results, backed by DuckDB.

Across a large corpus the same claim recurs constantly (many papers assert the same statin,
aspirin, or HRT effect), and those claims normalize to identical searches. Without a cache each
paper re-issues those searches and re-fetches the same studies, so retrieval time grows with the
corpus even though the distinct work is small. This cache stores two things in DuckDB and serves
them to every later paper, so each unique unit of work hits the network only once:

  * ``query_results`` maps a search query to its result, keyed by ``(source, query, page_size)``.
  * ``records`` maps a study id to its fetched record (title, abstract, publication types).

Both are checked first; the PubMed or Europe PMC API is called only on a miss, and the result is
then written back. It is opt-in: set ``MEDSCREEN_QUERY_CACHE`` to a file path (or to ``1``/``on``
for the default path) to enable it; leave it unset to fetch live every time, preserving the
existing behaviour of a no-cache run. Access is guarded by a lock because the filter and harness
fan papers out across threads, while the network call itself runs outside the lock.
