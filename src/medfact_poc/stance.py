"""Stance classification: does a candidate support, refute, or stay neutral on the
claim *as asserted* (conditions included)?

This is measurement instrumentation, not the production annotator. Using an LLM as
the stance judge here is acceptable precisely because the stance step is one of the
variables the harness measures (its correctness shows up as the gap between
retrieval recall and stance recall). It must never be promoted into a "is this claim
true" judge in a real pipeline.

Backends are pluggable:
  * ``stub`` — deterministic lexical heuristic; dependency-free, for plumbing.
  * ``llm``  — any provider behind ``llm.LLMClient`` (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) with a
    condition-aware prompt returning structured JSON. ``anthropic``/``openai``/``gemini``
    are accepted as aliases that also pin the provider.
